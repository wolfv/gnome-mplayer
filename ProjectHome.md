Gnome MPlayer has a rich API that is exposed via DBus. Using DBus you can control a single or multiple instances of GNOME MPlayer from a single command.

Gnome MPlayer is not dependent on any Gnome libraries. However. the look and feel of the application is based on the Gnome HIG. The main dependencies are on GTK2 or GTK3, GLIB2 and DBUS.

Gnome MPlayer requires the GMTK library which can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/gmtk/).
