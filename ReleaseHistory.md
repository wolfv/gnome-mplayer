# Introduction #

GNOME MPlayer is a simple GUI for MPlayer. It is intended to be a nice tight player and provide a simple and clean interface to MPlayer. GNOME MPlayer has a rich API that is exposed via DBus. Using DBus you can control a single or multiple instances of GNOME MPlayer from a single command.

The player can be used to play media on websites when used with Gecko Mediaplayer
